Debian images on Scaleway [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-debian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scaleway/image-debian)
=====================================

Scripts to build the official Debian images on Scaleway

These images are built using [Image Tools](https://github.com/scaleway/image-tools) and depends on the [armhf port of debian docker images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/armbuild/debian/).

**This image is meant to be used on a C1 server.**

We use the Docker's building system and convert it at the end to a disk image that will boot on real servers without Docker. Note that the image is still runnable as a Docker container for debug or for inheritance.
